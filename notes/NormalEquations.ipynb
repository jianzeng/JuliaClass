In animal breeding applications, $p$ may be large, but  $\\mathbf{X'X}$ is often very sparse, i.e., has very few non-zero elements. Efficient algorithms take advantage of this sparse structure to reduce computing time and storage requirements.

    "One way to proceed would be to first build $\\mathbf{X}$ and then get $\\mathbf{X'X}$ by matrix multiplication. This, however, is very inefficient both in computational and storage requirements. For example, suppose $n$ is a million and $p$ is a thousand. Then, $\\mathbf{X}$ would have thousand million elements whereas $\\mathbf{X'X}$ has million elements, which is thousand times smaller than $\\mathbf{X}$. Thus, if $\\mathbf{X'X}$ can be computed without first building $\\mathbf{X}$, the storage requirements would be much lower. "
